/**
 * This is a mock implementation of the k6/execution module for non-k6 environments.

 * It is used to avoid relying on the k6/execution module in the Deno runtime,

 * implementation that does not abort the test. While making sure that we do replace
 * it with the real k6/execution module when bundling for the k6 runtime (using esbuild).
 * 
 * It allows us to use the `deno test` command and unit tests in the Deno runtime. While
 * still being able to use the `k6 run` command and tests in the k6 runtime.
